# About This Project

# **1. PROJECT GOALS**
The objective of this project is to create a dashboard that consolidates insights obtained from the LEGO product dataset covering the years 1970 to 2022. The intention is for the resultant dashboard to facilitate a more straightforward understanding of the dataset's contents for a wide audience.

# **2. ABOUT THE DATASET**
The dataset utilized in this challenge was obtained through data scraping from the Brickset website. Key observations about this dataset are as follows:
- Following a credibility check through sample verification from official sources, it was confirmed that the data was reliable.
- The dataset comprises a total of 18,457 rows.
- No instances of duplicate rows were detected.
- Inconsistencies in capitalization were identified in the subtheme column, highlighting the need for standardization.
- Retail prices are absent in more than 60% of the products, likely attributed to discontinuation, making them no longer available in the market.
- Information on the minimum age is lacking for over 60% of the products.

# **3. DASHBOARD**
The dashboard comprises three sections, featuring a main page as the central navigation hub to guide users to their desired topics by selecting from the displayed options.
